# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - CodeAlpha Task

This project demonstrates a basic Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Python and the Scapy library. It's designed to monitor network traffic in real-time, identify predefined suspicious activities based on simple rules, and alert the user.

## Overview

This solution fulfills the requirements of the CodeAlpha Network Intrusion Detection System task by providing a functional Python script that:

1.  **Acts as a NIDS:** Captures and inspects network packets.
2.  **Configures Rules and Alerts:** Contains internal rules (signatures) to detect suspicious patterns. When a rule is triggered, an alert is displayed.
3.  **Monitors Network Traffic:** Continuously processes live network data.
4.  **Implements Response Mechanisms:** Provides simple console alerts. For real-world scenarios, this would involve integration with SIEMs, automated blocking, or detailed logging.
5.  **Visualizes Detected Attacks (Conceptual):** While direct graphical visualization is beyond this simple script's scope, the clear, color-coded console output serves as a basic form of real-time monitoring and "visualization" of alerts. For advanced visualization, integration with tools like the ELK Stack would be required to process the logs generated by such a system.

## Features

* **Real-time Packet Capture**: Sniffs network packets from a specified or default interface.
* **Layered Protocol Analysis**: Provides basic breakdowns for Ethernet, IP (v4/v6), TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DNS layers.
* **Rule-Based Detection**: Identifies predefined suspicious patterns in network traffic (e.g., specific HTTP requests, DNS queries for malicious domains, Telnet connections, pings from certain IPs).
* **Color-coded Alerts**: Displays clear, color-coded alerts when suspicious activity is detected.
* **Payload Inspection**: Shows raw payload data for analysis when alerts are triggered.
* **Timestamping**: Each packet display includes a precise timestamp.
* **Error Handling**: Includes basic error handling for common issues like insufficient privileges.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Scapy library
* Colorama library

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scapy colorama
